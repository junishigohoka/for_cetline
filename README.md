# Protocols and materials for Cetline

This is the repository where I prepare protocols for Cetline's project.
All source files are in `src`, and all protocols can be compiled in `protocols_pdf` by running `compile_all.sh` (You need `pandoc`, `Rscript`, and `rmarkdown`).


Folders
- images: contains images used in protocols
- literature: contains papers in the reading list of `plan.pdf` in PDF.
- protocols_docx: contains docx files automatically generated by `pandoc`
- protocols_pdf: contains all protocols in PDF
- scripts: contains custom scripts used in analyses
- src: contains markdown and Rmd files for all protocols
- test_data: contains test data used in protocols


Files
- compile_all.sh: a shell script to compile all protocols from src/ to protocols_pdf/
- plan.pdf: the general guide for Cetline made from `src/plan.md`.
- README.md: this file
