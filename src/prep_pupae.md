# Background

To perform both eclosion phenotyping and genotyping of the same individual, we need to keep track of individual flies.
To this end, we place individual pupae in a 96-well plate, and the closed plate will be monitored.
Flies will eclose in each well, after which they will be sacrificed and processed for genotyping in the designated well.


# Objectives

To prepare pupae in a 96-well plate for eclosion recording.



# Materials

- 96-well plates [TODO: Product info]
- Fly vials (7 days after egg lay)
- Toothpicks
- Water in a petri dish


# Methods

1. Using a toothpick, gently detach individual pupae from the side of the vial.^[Soaking the toothpick with water can help]
1. Place one pupa in one well of the 96-well plate.
